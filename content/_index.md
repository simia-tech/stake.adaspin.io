One big advantage of Cardano is it's decentral architecture. While other cryptocurrencies are decentral in theorey
and processed on just a few nodes in practice, Cardano spreads the work across many stake pools.

Therefore we set up the **AdaSpin Stake Pool** to provide our humble contribution to the Cardano network. We're very
much interested in bringing Cardano to real-world applications, rather than speculate on high exchange rates.

The pool ...

* charges the fixed minimum of 340 ADA and a margin of 0%
* runs at a certified german hosting provider
* uses engery-saving hardware powered by carbon-neutral energy
* is managed and monitored by experienced admins

We're aware that rewards are only distributed in stake pools that produces blocks and that small pools like this
one will have to wait many epochs till it's elected to produces one. But since there is less stake on the pool, the
reward is shared bewteen less delegators and the individual share is therefor higher.

Your ADA delegation is very welcome.
